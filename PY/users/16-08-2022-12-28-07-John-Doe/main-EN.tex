\section{Introduction}

Thank you for your confidence in this manual. This document describes step-by-step how to assemble the cabinet you specified. This chapter briefly explains the different parts of the assembly process. The shopping list is discussed in chapter two. The third chapter focuses on assembling your new closet. All measurements described in this manual are in centimeters unless otherwise indicated. \\

Despite the fact that a lot of attention has been paid to this model, it is always possible that there are errors. We therefore recommend that you carefully read the document for errors or inconsistencies before purchasing parts. If you come across errors, could you let us know? We will then correct the error and you will receive your money back for both this manual and the modified assembly manual. We are \underline{not} responsible for any damages (both physical and financial) resulting from following this manual. \\

The cabinet designed by us has the following exterior dimensions and floors: \\

\section{Shopping list}

To assemble the cabinet you will need the following materials and tools. \\

\subsection{Materials}

First of all, the planks and beams. You can use both planed and unplaned wood for this. Unplaned wood is cheaper, but note that the dimensions of these planks and beams can differ. It may therefore be necessary to remove extra wood during construction due to the deviating dimensions.

\input{s0-kooplijst_hout}

The following properties have been drawn up for the legs. You are free to choose any leg shape here as long as the number and height of the chosen legs correspond to the table below.

\input{s0-poten}

The table of the required screws is shown below. We recommend that you use wood screws with an M4 diameter. \href{https://www.amazon.nl/gp/product/B00B214ZLQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1}{These M4 wood screws} (figure \ref{fig:schroeven}) are a good option. Please note that the length of the screw may be different for your cabinet. Select a screw that has a length close to the 'max length'. Do not take longer screws, they will go through the wood which does not give a nice finish.

\input{s0-schroeven}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering

    \caption{Connex M4 Screws from Amazon}
    \label{fig:schroeven}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Finally, additional metal parts are needed for the construction. For the corner frames it is recommended to select one with 4 holes and a maximum width of 3 centimeters. These ensure a strong connection. \href{https://www.amazon.nl/Connex-HVG2400-voordeelpak-hoekverbinder-verzinkt/dp/B00J7L2ET8/ref=sr_1_9?__mk_nl_NL=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95% C3%91&crid=22ED59WFFPB0Z&keywords=corner connector&qid=1660427081&sprefix=corner connector%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-9}{These corner connections} (figure \ref{fig:hoeken}) are a good option. For the hinges and locks you are of course completely free to choose which one best suits your personal taste.

\subsection{Tools}

The tools below are required to build this cabinet.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pencil
    \item Sawtable
    \item Screwmachine
    \item Measuring tape
\end{itemize}

In addition, the following items are optional. If you are using wood that has not been planed, the parts below are particularly recommended as unplaned planks can have significant variations in thickness, width and straightness.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Jigsaw
    \item Scrape
    \item Tri square
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    \textit{Tip: Don't have tools at hand? Then try searching for it via \href{https://www.peerby.com/}{Peerby}!}
\end{center}

\section{Cutting list}

\subsection{Planks and beams length}

The table below shows how the beams and planks \underline{to length} are cut. The minimum required number of planks and beams has been calculated, if you do not follow this saw list you may run out of wood.

\input{s0-plank_opt}

\input{s0-balk_opt}

\subsection{Planks and beams width}

Now that the planks and beams have been sawn, some of the planks also need to be adjusted in width and length. Select the planks from the list and cut them to the required width. \\

\begin{center}
    \textit{Tip: write the measurements on the planks and beams with a pencil for quick reference later!}

\section{Assembly}

\subsection{Step 1 - Bottom and feet}

First of all, you construct the base of the cabinet. The table below shows the materials required for this step. In this table, the first row is the cabinet legs and the next are the shelves for the bottom.

\input{s1-voeten}

The image below shows how the legs are attached to the shelves. The order of laying the boards is irrelevant. To fix the legs in the planks, use \textbf{two screws} per foot. For this you step use \textbf{screw 1} as indicated in table 4 of chapter 2.

Sizes shown are from the left side of the cabinet to the beginning of the leg. Legs are placed at the ends of the cabinet in width. The image below is depicted extra large in the appendix.
